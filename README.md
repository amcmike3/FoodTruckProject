# Food Truck Project

## Description
- This application will prompt a user to enter a food truck name, food served, and rating up to 5 food trucks.
- If the user enters quit on the food truck name they will be prompted with another menu where they can display information based on the inputs given. like average rating, list of food trucks, highest rated food truck, or quit entire program.
- Special use case that had to be handled: when a user immediately quits application before entering any food trucks. 

## Limitations: 
- program cannot handle errors like null pointer exceptions (although it is highly unlikely that would happen) or a more likely scenario where a user enters the wrong data type at the prompt. 
- Program is limited to 5 food trucks.
- does not store any data long-term (once program finished all data is lost).
